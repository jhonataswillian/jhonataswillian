## About Me

I'm a backend developer passionate about building products that solve real problems. With 7 months of hands-on experience at SouJunior Labs, I've contributed to a marketplace platform through 12+ agile sprints, where I architected REST APIs, designed database schemas, and maintained 80%+ test coverage.

Currently, I'm developing three SaaS products from scratch (resume builder, contract analyzer, and content discovery platform), applying everything I've learned about scalable architecture, user authentication, payment integration, and deployment strategies.

**Location:** Americana, SP 🇧🇷  
**Availability:** Immediate for internships (Remote/Hybrid)
