## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a backend developer who believes code should solve real problems, not just compile. With **7 months of production experience** at SouJunior Labs, I've shipped features in a marketplace platform through 12+ agile sprints, where I architected REST APIs, optimized database queries, and maintained high test coverage.

Currently, I’m building Currify (MVP launched) – a resume builder with 98% ATS compatibility using React, TypeScript and Supabase. I also maintain two other SaaS projects in development: a trading journal for traders to record their operations and track performance statistics, and a "Secret Santa - (Amigo Secreto)" game for families and friends, where users create groups, draw names anonymously, share wishlists and manage the final reveal online.

**What drives me:** Turning ideas into scalable products that people actually use.

**Currently seeking:** Backend/Fullstack Developer internship opportunities to grow alongside experienced engineers and contribute to impactful projects.
